This chance applies independently to each hit of a multi-hit move.\n\n    This item's chance is rolled independently of any other move effects;\ne.g., a move with a 30% chance to flinch normally will have a 37% total chance to flinch when used with this item, because 3% of the time, both effects activate.\n\nHeld by []{pokemon:poliwhirl} or []{pokemon:slowbro}\n:   Holder evolves into []{pokemon:politoed} or []{pokemon:slowking}, respectively, when traded."
